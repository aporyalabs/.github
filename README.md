# Aporya Research

Independent research institute focused on decoding human context in non-linear, automated environments.

## Core Framework: IDM Spiral Model
**Intent–Drift–Meaning (IDM)** – an epistemic framework for mapping how human meaning evolves under systemic constraint and context collapse.

- **Human Intent**: Meaning-bearing forces irreducible to behavioral signals  
- **Human Drift**: Directional mutation of meaning across automated environments  
- **Context Collapse**: Systemic flattening of situational depth into machine-legible signals  

## Canonical Research
Peer-reviewed publication anchoring the framework:

## Operational Mode
**Mode HØ9** – deep contextual sensing and high-fidelity modeling.
