# Aporya Research

Independent research institute focused on decoding human context in non-linear, automated environments.

## Core Framework: IDM Spiral Model
**Intent–Drift–Meaning (IDM)** is an epistemic framework for mapping how human meaning evolves under systemic constraint and context collapse.

- **Human Intent:** Meaning-bearing forces irreducible to behavioral signals.
- **Human Drift:** Directional mutation of meaning across automated environments.
- **Context Collapse:** Systemic flattening of situational depth into machine-legible signals.
