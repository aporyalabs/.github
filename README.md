# Aporya Research

**Aporya Research** is the independent research stream of the **Aporya Institute**, focused on decoding human context in non-linear, automated environments.

This repository serves as an organizational surface for ongoing research activity and technical constructs. Materials published here are working models and evolving frameworks.

## Canonical Research Hub
Stabilized definitions, canonical models, and consolidated frameworks are anchored at the institute’s research hub:

## Core Framework: The IDM Spiral
Our work is centered on the **Intent–Drift–Meaning (IDM)** framework – an epistemic model for mapping how human meaning evolves under systemic constraint and context collapse.

- **Human Intent**  
  Meaning-bearing forces irreducible to behavioral signals.

- **Human Drift**  
  Directional mutation of meaning across automated environments.

- **Context Collapse**  
  The systemic flattening of situational depth into machine-legible signals.

## Operational Mode
Research and analysis are conducted under **Mode HØ9**, calibrated for deep contextual sensing and high-fidelity modeling.
